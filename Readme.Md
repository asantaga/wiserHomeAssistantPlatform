# Code Installation

We highly recommend using [HACS Home Assistant Community Store](https://github.com/hacs), for more information on how to install HACS please see their documentation website at https://hacs.xyz/

## Manual Code Installation

This method is best used when you want to play with the "latest and greatest" from the repository. Moving forward (post 1.9) , the github repository will contain two primary branches, **master** and dev. Master is the latest released, and hopefully most stable branch, whereas **dev** is the branch that we're currently working on.


1. On your server clone the github repository into a suitable directory using the following command
   git clone https://github.com/asantaga/wiserHomeAssistantPlatform.git

2. Switch to either the master or dev branch as per your requirements. 
   e.g.
   `git checkout master`
   or 
   `git checkout dev`

3. Create a `custom_components` directory within your Home Assistant directory config directory

4. Within the custom components directory copy the wiser folder, from the directory where you github cloned the wiser component, to your installations ```custom components``` directory.


# Configuration


## Find your HeatHub Secret key
Reference https://it.knightnet.org.uk/kb/nr-qa/drayton-wiser-heating-control/#controlling-the-system

Before you can use the component you need to find the HeatHub secret key, this involves a couple of steps.


1. Press the setup button on your HeatHub, the light will start flashing

2. Look for the Wi-Fi network (SSID) called **‘WiserHeatXXX’** where XXX is random

3. Connect to the network from a Windows/Linux/Mac machine

4. Execute the following REST call 
   * For Windows use
      `Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -UseBasicParsing -Uri http://192.168.8.1/secret/` 
   * For Linux (or Windows WSL) use 
     `curl http://192.168.8.1/secret`

   This will return a string which will contain your system secret, obviously dont share this...

5. Press the setup button on the HeatHub again and it will go back to normal operations

6. Copy the secret and save it somewhere.

7. Find Your HEATHUB IP
    Using your router, or some other method, identify the IP address of your HeatHub. On many routers it usually identifies itself as the something like ``WiserHeatXXXXXX`` 

    **We recommend you configure your router so that it assigns a FIXED IP address to the Wiser HeatHub. Whilst it "shouldnt" change IP address some people have noticed it has/does, perhaps when wiser issue a firmware update. Most routers allow you to reserve an IP address to a MAC address, this setting is often (like on Virgin Media Routers) done in the DHCP section.**   

8. Configure using Home Assistant Configuration Assistant "Set up new integration"

    ![](docs/add_configuration_image.png)

9. This will then show the config screen for Wiser Heat Hub, now configure it appropriately.

    ![](Z:\src\ha_dev\venv_wiser\homeassistant\src\docs\add_configuration_image2.png)

    ```minimum``` is the bottom minimum temperature to be recorded, the default is -5

    ```boost_temp``` is the delta temperature the radiator should be set to when boosted, default is 2

    ```boost_time``` is the time (in seconds) for which a boost should be active for, default is 30mins

10. When added, you should something like see this in integrations
    ![](Z:\src\ha_dev\venv_wiser\homeassistant\src\docs\add_configuration_image3.png)

11. Clicking on it should show you this and you can now add the devices to your Home Assistant Lovelace UI as you please
     ![](Z:\src\ha_dev\venv_wiser\homeassistant\src\docs\add_configuration_image4.png)

12. **Alternatively** you can also configure the integration using YAML. Here is a sample config, replace the HEATHUB AND PASSWORD appropriately.

```yaml
wiser:
  host: <ENTER YOUR HEATHUB IP HERE>
  password: <ENTER YOUR SECRET TOKEN, OBTAINED FROM STEP THREE HERE>
  scan_interval: 300
  minimum: -5
  boost_temp: 2
  boost_time: 30
```


## Managing Schedules with Home Assistant


### Getting a Schedule
Use the service `wiser.get_schedule`

This will require you to provide the entity ID of the wiser device and a file to copy this schedule to.
It is recommended to create a directory in your config directory to store these.  
See below for information on selecting the correct entity.

Note : If you are running HA within a docker container then the directory will be absolute to the container, if you have mapped the config directory to a local directory then all is good but the directory name given to the service must be a docker container address.

E.g. if you specify the filename as `/config/schedule.yaml` then `get_schedule` writes the file into the directory within the container. Providing you have mapped the config directory (using the -v or volumes: in docker-compose) then you can read this from a host directory (e.g. /home/haconfig.

### Setting a Schedule
Use the service `wiser.set_schedule`

This will require you to provide the entity ID of the wiser device and a file containing the schedule.  
See below for information on selecting the correct entity.

A good place to start is to get a schedule from a device and see the file structure.  You can add times and temps within each day as you see fit.  As file created using the `wiser.get_schedule` service looks like below:
```yaml
Name: Dining Room
Description: Schedule for Dining Room
Type: Heating
Monday:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Tuesday:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Wednesday:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Thursday:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Friday:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Saturday:
  - Time: 07:00
    Temp: 19
  - Time: 10:00
    Temp: 17
  - Time: 16:00
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 23:00
    Temp: 15
Sunday:
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 21
```
If you are creating your own file (or editing one you have copied from a wiser device), you can use the 2 special day
names of 'Weekdays' and 'Weekends' instead of listing individual days.  

e.g.

```yaml
Name: Test Room
Description: Schedule for Test Room
Type: Heating
Weekdays:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21.5
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Weekends:
  - Time: 07:00
    Temp: 19
  - Time: 10:00
    Temp: 17
  - Time: 16:00
    Temp: 20.5
  - Time: 23:00
    Temp: 15
```
You can also use a mixture of these special day names and normal days to override a specific day (providing the specific days names are below these special ones!).
```yaml
Name: Test Room
Description: Schedule for Test Room
Type: Heating
Weekdays:
  - Time: 07:30
    Temp: 21.5
  - Time: 08:30
    Temp: 15
  - Time: 16:30
    Temp: 20
  - Time: 22:30
    Temp: 15
Weekends:
  - Time: 07:00
    Temp: 19
  - Time: 10:00
    Temp: 17
  - Time: 16:00
    Temp: 20.5
  - Time: 23:00
    Temp: 15
Tuesday:
  - Time: 08:00
    Temp: 21.5
  - Time: 20:00
    Temp: 18.0
```

For hotwater and smartplugs (to make reading the schedule file easier) you can use time and state keys like below.  Note for both hot water and smartplugs, the Type parameter must be set to HotWater in your file.
```yaml
Name: Hot Water
Description: Schedule for Hot Water
Type: HotWater
Weekdays:
  - Time: 06:30
    State: On
  - Time: 10:30
    State: Off
  - Time: 16:30
    State: On
  - Time: 22:30
    State: Off
Weekends:
  - Time: 06:30
    State: On
  - Time: 10:30
    State: Off
  - Time: 16:30
    State: On
  - Time: 22:30
    State: Off
Tuesday:
  - Time: 08:00
    State: On
  - Time: 20:00
    State: Off
```


### Copying a Schedule
Use the service `wiser.copy_schedule`

This will require you to provide an entity ID of the device to copy from and the entity ID of the device to copy to and will copy the schedule between them.


### What Entity Should I Choose?
- Room heating schedules - use the climate entity of the room.  eg climate.lounge
- Hot water on/off schedule - use the sensor.hotwater entity
- Smartplug on/off schedules - use the switch entity of the smart plug eg switch.smartplug1


## Network Topology

With V1.9 for TRVs you can now determine if the TRV is connected to the heathub directly or via a smartplug repeater. 

Each TRV sensor now has three special network related attributes 

| Attribute        | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `node_id`        | The node Id of the device                                    |
| `parent_node_id` | If this value is zero (0) then the device is connected direct to the heathub. A non zero value points to the smartplug/repeater for which this device is being routed through. Smartplugs always have this value as zero |
| `hub_route`      | Calculated convenience attribute which the evaluates to either `direct` or `repeater` based on if the device is connected direct or not to the heathub |



## Battery Values

For each battery driven device sensor the following attributes are available `battery_voltage`, `battery_percentage` and `battery_level`. From conversations with Wiser technical support they recommend changing the batteries for any TRV when it reaches battery voltage of "26" or *OneThird* battery level. Given that RoomStats do not need to drive a valve, their battery levels can be lower.

An obvious ideal candidate for a Home Assistant automation to remind you to change the batteries :-)

Note : If you power cycle your HomeHub, with more than a minute or so when it is off, we've noticed that the devices will not have the battery info for a short period of time (maybe 30mins to 1hr) , just wait and the battery values will appear.

Moving forward (post 1.9) there will be two primary branches, `master` and `dev` . Master will be the primary "production" branch and "dev" will be the branch used for development. Other branches will likely exist where we build code into and then merge into dev, which in turn gets merged into master when all is good and dandy.
