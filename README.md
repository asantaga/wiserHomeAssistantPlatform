This repository contains a Home Assistant integration for the awesome Drayton Wiser Heating solution.  This integration works locally with your wiser hub and does not rely on the cloud.

It also supports some European versions of the Wiser Hub under the Schneider Electric brand, including support for lights and blinds.

For the latest version of the Wiser Home Assistant Platform please install via HACS. If you want bleeding edge then checkout the dev branch, or look out for beta releases via HACS. Depending on what you choose you may need to use the Manual Code Installation as described in the Wiki.

**This integration requires a minimum HA version of 2024.2.**

Detailed information about this integration has now been moved to our [Wiki pages](https://github.com/asantaga/wiserHomeAssistantPlatform/wiki)
